# Create a React App to display a news feed (in progress)

Got started with a simple react boilerplate: 

[The Minimal React + Webpack 4 + Babel Setup](https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/)


## Getting Started

From the root folder : 

```
npm install
```

All the React dependencies will be installed. Next you 
can get the app started with : 

```
npm start
```

You will see live changes on http://localhost:8080/
